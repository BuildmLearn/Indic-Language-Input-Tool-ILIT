Radial Dial Method.

The dial will be available as a Floating Button.
Vowels or Diacritics, are on a circular dial. 
These will be dynamically generated, the dial can be rotated. And on touch it will generate the given letter.
Useful for the designs consisting of vowels.

Say when no letter is pressed, dial will have A,AA,E,EE...(in Gujarati or Hindi Letters).
When letter is pressed, dial will have its forms...K,Ka,Ki,Kee....

	Advantage :-New Design.Uses new age UI.
				Smooth Circular Menu is visibily good for user to see.
				Will make typing fast once user gets used to.
				Dynamically creates the combinations.(k+vowels----ka,ki...)
				
	Disadvantage :- Difficult to design.
				Need to make perfect design to fit any size of screen.(As the size of dial and angles will change)
